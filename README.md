# RSS Feed for CPython Releases

_Want to know when new versions of CPython are available?_

RSS to the rescue!

I build my own CPython from source on the regular, and I didn't want to have to
manually check the downloads page to find out when new versions drop.

I wasn't able to find an RSS feed that gave me what I was looking for (see
[`python/pythondotorg#1612`][#1612] for more context), so I built my own.

Point your RSS feed reader [here][rss xml], and get notified!
